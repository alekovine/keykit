Version: 3.0, released August 7th 2018

MuldjordKit3 is the newest version of the Muldjord kit. The recordings stem from a drum kit recording session I did back in 2009 where I played drums for the now defunct band Sepulchrum (www.sepulchrum.net).
Whenever I record drums for anything I always do samples of each drum, if I need them to patch things up later on in the mixing stages. It turns out that I was so thorough with this process, that I could turn it into a fully fledged DrumGizmo kit. And MuldjordKit was born!

The kit contains the following components (Left / right placements as seen by the drummer):

 * 2 kickdrums
 * 3 hanging toms
 * 1 floor tom
 * 1 snare
 * 1 hihat
 * 2 crash cymbals
 * 2 ride cymbals
 * 1 china cymbal

This should be considered a metal or rock kit.
